# Dance-Moms---Fights
In this project analysis, I will be analyzing the fights that the dance teacher gets into with the parents and watching if it visibly affects the kids and I will also be analyzing the fights between the parents and seeing the effects of the children.
The Operationalizations are based on if the children were visibly affected by the fights between the teacher and parents as well as of the children were visibly affected by the fights between the parents themselves. 
I counted off each episode of the children were affected or not for each operationlization
